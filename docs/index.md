### Features

* private recipes: The server enables you to use your own recipes for your own packages, even with Satis or Private Packagist.
* seamless integration: The server integrates with the official symfony.sh-endpoint and will serve the official recipes as well as your own ones.
* caching and mirroring: The server can easily be configured to mirror the official repos so that you are completely independent.
