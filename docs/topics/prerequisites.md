# System requirements

In order to run the server, you'll need a server which

* is capable of running Symfony 4. This means: PHP 7.2
* has git installed
* has Composer installed
* is able to load the repos. That means: Access to the internet is needed, also some free disk space.

It is recommended to setup some sort of monitoring. We use [Sentry](https://sentry.io).

SSH access is useful to run [commands](commands.md) on the server.
